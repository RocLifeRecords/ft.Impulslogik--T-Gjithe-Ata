Ti e do Drejtësinë is a double album by Albanian pop/rap singer DenyD released 2017.

Recorded during 2016-2017 in Tirana, Ti e do Drejtësinë was aimed to be an pop/rap album. It features are many Ambient music samples.

Background and promotion

I stuck to an original idea to make an pop/rap album, even in my conscious that some tracks don't sound like a proper rap at first listen. The best example is the song "Pop-Rap Garanci", which does not sound like rap when you listen to it the first time. But if you forget all, the bass lines are just really basic rap shape. As a dance music, is not an idea of a good times, but as electronic-pop, so much fool as kinetic.

Twelve songs was released as the Vol I (CD1), before the entire album Vol II (CD2) release. "Ti e do Drejtësinë Vol I" was the first unit of the rapper in 2016 and featured "Ti e do Drejtësinë Vol I & II", was the primary medium album in 2017.

The double album "Ti e do Drejtësinë Vol I & II" in long-term is to support the justice system in Albania, from various experts, assistant's, translators etc. Specifically, to refer the concept of the religion and politics in justice where some Jews, Muslims and Christians believe that the justice is the present, real, right and a command divine derived from God. The Psalmist describes God as having "Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of his throne;....." (Psalms 89:14)
